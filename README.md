# Getting started with Phoenix LiveView Guide üê¶

## Guide
[Read Guide Here](https://github.com/RustySnek/getting-started-with-liveview/blob/master/GUIDE.md)

## Quick Background
Hey, this guide was heavly inspired by [(Very Unofficial) Getting Started with Elixir Phoenix Guide](https://github.com/andyklimczak/getting-started-with-phoenix) which is a recreation of the [Getting Started with Rails Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
Andy left out the LiveView topic so I re-created his guide focusing on it. I've decided to keep to the original while adding LiveView's concepts like
live form validation, live navigation and asyncs.


If there are better/simpler ways to do something, please create an issue or PR. You'll help me understand how to write better Phoenix, but others as well. Thank you!
